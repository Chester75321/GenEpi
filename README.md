# GenEpi
GenEpi is a package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by a machine learning approach, developed by Yu-Chuan Chang at [c4Lab](http://bioinfo.bime.ntu.edu.tw/c4lab/) of National Taiwan University and Taiwan AI Labs

The architecture and modules of GenEpi.

## Introduction

GenEpi is designed to group SNPs by a set of loci in the gnome. For examples, a locus could be a gene. In other words, we use gene boundaries to group SNPs. A locus can be generalized to any particular regions in the genome, e.g. promoters, enhancers, etc. GenEpi first considers the genetic variants within a particular region as features in the first stage, because it is believed that SNPs within a functional region might have a higher chance to interact with each other and to influence molecular functions. 

GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and models them by L1-regularized regression with stability selection In the first stage (STAGE 1) of GenEpi, the genotype features from each single gene will be combinatorically encoded and modeled independently by L1-regularized regression with stability selection. In this way, we can estimate the prediction performance of each gene and detect within-gene epistasis with a low false positive rate. In the second stage (STAGE 2), both of the individual SNP and the within-gene epistasis features selected by STAGE 1 are pooled together to generate cross-gene epistasis features, and modeled again by L1-regularized regression with stability selection as STAGE 1. Finally, the user can combine the selected genetic features with environmental factors such as clinical features to build the final prediction models.

## Citing

Please considering cite the following paper (currently avaliables as a pre-print in BioRxiv) if you use GenEpi in a scientific publication:

[1] Yu-Chuan Chang, June-Tai Wu, Ming-Yi Hong, Yi-An Tung, Ping-Han Hsieh, Sook Wah Yee, Kathleen M. Giacomini, Yen-Jen Oyang, and Chien-Yu Chen. "Genepi: Gene-Based Epistasis Discovery Using Machine Learning." bioRxiv  (2019): 421719.

## Quickstart
This section gets you started quickly. The completed GenEpi's documentation please find on [Welcome to GenEpiâ€™s docs!](https://genepi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Installation
```
$ pip install GenEpi
```

>**NOTE:** GenEpi is a memory-consuming package, which might cause memory errors when calculating the epistasis of a gene containing a large number of SNPs. We recommend that the memory for running GenEpi should be over 256 GB.

### Running a quick test
Please use following command to run a quick test, you will obtain all the outputs of GenEpi in your current folder.
```
$ GenEpi -g example -p example -o ./
```

### Interpreting the main results table
GenEpi will automatically generate three folders (snpSubsets, singleGeneResult, crossGeneResult) beside your .GEN file. You could go to the folder **crossGeneResult** directly to obtain your main table for episatasis in **Result.csv**.

>The first column lists each feature by its RSID and the genotype (denoted as RSID_genotype), the pairwise epistatis features are represented using two SNPs. The last column describes the genes where the SNPs are located according to the genomic coordinates. We used a star sign to denote the epistasis between genes. The p-values of the &chi;<sup>2</sup> test (the quantitative task will use student t-test) are also included. The odds ratio significantly away from 1 also indicates whether the features are potential causal or protective genotypes. Since low genotype frequency may cause unreliable odds ratios, we also listed this information in the table.
